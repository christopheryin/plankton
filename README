Code for implementing, training, and fine-tuning a SqueezeNet CNN architecture for classification of sand images from database of images from underwater microscope camera beneath the Scripps Pier.

Images pulled from Scripps Plankton Camera System (http://spc.ucsd.edu/imagedata/spcview-plankton-camera-image-browser/) and labeled by Bojian Xu


Record of classifier performance for varying training parameters:

    sand_model1.h5 - trained with transfer learning only, 3 epochs: 0.797 acc
    sand_model2.h5 - trained with transfer learning only, 6 epochs: 0.77 acc
    sand_model3.h5 - trained w/ tranfer learning + finetuning to layer 34, 3 epochs: 0.754 acc
    sand_model4.h5 - trained w/ transfer learning + finetuning to layer 34, 5 epochs (batch=64): 0.745 acc
    sand_model5.h5 - trained w/ transfer learning + finetuning to layer 19, 5 epochs (batch=64): 0.839 acc
    sand_model6.h5 - trained w/ transfer learning + finetuning to layer 11, 8 epochs (batch=128): 0.816 acc

Note: repo also contains code for fine-tuning inception. This hasn't been explored yet, will potentially attempt in the future.
